When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Remote repository is usefull if you work with several computers or you want 
to show your code to someone or you want to work together with someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pull changes manually helps you to control the remote repository and add only
those files you want to be visible for the others. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks works the same as clones but only in Github, and saves some additional 
information allowing to connect them with the original files from which fork was made.
Clones works as copy paste just creating a new folder with all files cloned.
No connection to the original.
Branches works on git repository and keeps the connection to master files,
works like separate unit, but can be merged with master when needed. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It helps to reveal conflicting changes and to use different commands to solve
those changes correctly.
